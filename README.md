# Grade_Calculator
This is a project that I worked on during my cybersecurity class at the university. This website allows the user to enter some data related to outcomes of his/her grades and gets some values returned such as average estimation, weighted average, degree awarded etc.
It performs a great validation procedure using bcrypt as an encryption algorithm
